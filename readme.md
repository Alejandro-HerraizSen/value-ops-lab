# Value-Ops Lab

Risk-aware FP&A and Working-Capital Optimizer for consulting and PE contexts.

This project brings together:
- **CCC Diagnostics**: DSO, DPO, DIO, CCC calculation with what-if waterfall impacts.
- **Risk-aware Forecasting**: CVaR-based cash buffer sizing under uncertainty.
- **Dynamic Policy Optimizer**: DP-style decision support for vendor/customer payment terms.
- **PE Extras**: Driver-based EBITDA bridge and LBO sensitivities.
